# ConserveEnergyMcu
An approach to reduce electricity wastage by monitoring the wifi network to shut the power supply off/on.

The project has 3 Modules: 
1. Hardware
2. Software
3. Server 

Working:
According to the survey, it was noted that a lot of energy is being wasted every year just because of carelessness. People are in a hurry that no one has enough to keep a track of all the electrical switches that they turned on. It was found that all the energy that is being wasted due to carelessness is being conserved, there would enough of the power to light up an entire village for months. 

The Approach:
We assume that in an organization, there is a wifi network from which the employees of that organization are connected to. They use it constantly to send emails, surf internet and a lot of different work. But with every device they use, they expose it's MAC Address to that wifi that can be read to know who is still connected to the wifi and who is not. If a person is having a phone connected to the wifi, that would mean that the person is still in the building unless the person leaves his phone accidentally but that is so rare these days. And if a person leaves the building, his/her device will no longer be attached to the wifi. This cancept can be used to control the main power supply of individual person's cabin as well as the entire building.
